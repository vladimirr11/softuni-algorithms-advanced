# softuni-algorithms-advanced
This repo contains more advanced algorithmic technique for solving graph and dynamic programming problems like - topological sorting, MST, finding shortest path in graph with negative weights, finding longest path in DAG, graphs strongly connected components and max flow as well as analysis of amortization and problem classification (P, NP, NP-completeness, Reductions).
