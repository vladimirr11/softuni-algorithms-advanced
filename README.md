# softuni-algorithms-advanced
This repo contains more advanced algorithmic technique for solving graph and dynamic programming problems such as - topological sorting, MST, finding shortest path in graph with negative weights, finding longest path in DAG, graphs strongly connected components and max flow. 
Analysis of amortization and problem classification (P, NP, NP-completeness, Reductions) are also considered.
